And you are capable of doing anything &#8211; even to write an essay at the last minute if only you know how to write an assignment on a topic. Primarily, you should prepare yourself for the task in the following ways:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-72\" src=\"https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/time-needed-for-assignment-writing.jpg\" alt=\"time for assignment writing\" width=\"512\" height=\"342\" srcset=\"https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/time-needed-for-assignment-writing.jpg 512w, https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/time-needed-for-assignment-writing-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"background-color: #66ccff;\">Use time management skills.<\/span><\/strong> The first thing that you should do is to plan your time needed for assignment writing. This time shouldn\u2019t include any other activities &#8211; being on the phone, eating or any other things you like to do. There are numerous distractions, for example, games, TV shows, and social media sites. If you wait until the last minute to do the assignment, then spend this time watching a YouTube channel, the chances that you will deliver the high-quality work are minimal. You will be more focused on beating the deadline rather than writing a good assignment. Plan your time according to our professional approach.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"background-color: #66ffff;\">Analyze the assignment question.<\/span><\/strong> Before you start writing anything, you have to understand the question that you need to answer. Only after the full understanding of the topic question, you can go ahead to write a good essay. Read the assignment topic carefully word by word. If there is any word that you are not familiar with, find its meaning in the <a href=\"https:\/\/en.oxforddictionaries.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Oxford Dictionary<\/a> or any other definition dictionary you wish. Even native English speakers can apply this way of clarifying words\/phrases, not to speak about international ones who have just started learning English. If you can\u2019t do it yourself, ask your friends or the lecturer for clarification. Imagine you need to write <a href=\"https:\/\/www.monash.edu\/rlo\/quick-study-guides\/writing-a-critical-review\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a critical review<\/a> on the scholar article. Be on the lookout for limiting words like \u2018analyze the scope of the issue\u2019, \u2018evaluate the merits of the text\u2019, \u2018judge the arguments\u2019, etc. Pay attention to everything that makes the assignment more specific.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ff99ff;\">Understand how marks are awarded.<\/span><\/strong> Most students don\u2019t check the guide on how marks will be awarded for writing an essay or research paper. Good students go through the essay assessment checklist to determine what the examiner is looking for when assessing the assignment. This helps students to focus on the relevant fields that will win them marks. Look at the typical <a href=\"https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/pjlynch\/essay-assessment-rubric\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">essay assessment template<\/a> and work on those points that are weak in your essays.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"background-color: #ccffcc;\"><strong>Look for reliable information.<\/strong> <\/span>After understanding the topic and how marks are awarded, start hunting for information that will be useful for your assignment. You can get some credible information either from books or the Internet. Do you like to do everything digitally? No time to visit the university library? Great! You can find some reliable data if you follow the following guidelines.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffff33;\">Draft an outline.<\/span><\/strong> Even a rough outline of your assignment shows how to structure it in a logical way. This structure ensures that you keep on the right track and don\u2019t go off topic. If you don\u2019t know how to make an outline for your assignments look for a relevant outline sample. In fact, it is possible to use any sticky notes at hand or draw diagrams for a quick effect.

The following are some of the tips on how to write a good assignment.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><span style=\"background-color: #9999ff;\">Introduction.<\/span><\/strong> This is the first paragraph of your assignment that gives the examiner a clear picture of whether you know what you are doing or you are just surviving in a college or university. You must know what details help you <a href=\"https:\/\/explorable.com\/how-to-write-an-introduction\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">write a good introduction<\/a>. Firstly, you are required to discuss the contextual background of the topic. Your arguments should be supported with citations or quotations from credible authors. To show the examiner that you understand the topic question, write down this question using your own words and explain. You should, however, avoid repeating the question word by word (a mistake made by most students). Secondly, you need to state your stand on the topic. Whether you support it or you are against it. The stand you state in the introduction cannot be changed later in the assignment. Thirdly, develop a thesis statement in the last sentence. This is the most important sentence in the assignment. If you get the thesis statement wrong, then, you can fail that particular assignment.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ff9999;\">Main body.<\/span><\/strong> The main part of your assignment should specifically answer the topic question citing some pieces of evidence. There is no limit to how many paragraphs the main body should contain. However, all the paragraphs have the same structure. That is, they should introduce an idea\/argument in a topic sentence, provide the evidence to support the idea, then link the idea to the thesis statement. This structure applies to all paragraphs in the main section.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"background-color: #00ffff;\">Conclusion.<\/span><\/strong> This part is a place where you conclude all above-mentioned in your essay based on the evidence you present. No new idea should be presented in the conclusion. You should, however, highlight areas that need further research in the future.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>#3 Post-Writing Tips<\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-78\" src=\"https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/information-that-will-be-useful-for-your-assignment.png\" alt=\"information that will be useful for your assignment\" width=\"305\" height=\"512\" srcset=\"https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/information-that-will-be-useful-for-your-assignment.png 305w, https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/information-that-will-be-useful-for-your-assignment-179x300.png 179w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Irrespective of whether you are a native English speaker or not, you should edit and proofread your assignment.

Once again, look at the assessment schedule. Don\u2019t shy off from adding a few details, if you feel something is not adding up.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffcc99;\">Check for grammar and spelling errors.<\/span><\/strong> Going through your paper gives you a chance to correct any silly grammar errors and spelling mistakes.<\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"background-color: #99ffcc;\">Double check the citations.<\/span><\/strong>\u00a0Have you used any citations in your assignment? Now, check if you have cited the sources correctly according to APA, MLA or Harvard guidelines. A wrong citation will deduct your marks. Moreover, you may be accused of plagiarism.
