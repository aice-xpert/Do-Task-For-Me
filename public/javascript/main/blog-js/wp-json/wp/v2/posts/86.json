You can read English storybooks, find various stories online or even read works from your more creative friend. Today, many creative people have the possibility to keep a blog from which they can take some creative ideas for their assignments. When reading, pay attention to the plot of the story to grasp the author&#8217;s thoughts and feelings. If you come across any word that you are not familiar with, write it on a piece of paper and find its meaning in a dictionary, for example, in <a href=\"https:\/\/en.oxforddictionaries.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the Oxford Dictionary<\/a> or any other that is reliable enough.<\/p>\n<h3>2) Rewrite a Story<\/h3>\n<p>Rewriting is one of the most effective ways to improve your creative writing skills <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and handle all the assignment writing for students like a pro<\/span>. Don\u2019t get surprised that rewriting can help you become creative as rewriting involves using your own words or paraphrasing. Don\u2019t act in such a way. If you find a good story\/article interesting, rewrite it according to your preferences or vision. Use different characters and words and different views of the plot.<\/p>\n<h3>3) Keep a Personal Journal<\/h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t know how creative you can be until you keep a personal journal. If something interesting, heartbreaking, or boring happens, write it down in your personal journal<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, even if it\u2019s something like, \u201cI need to write my assignment, and that\u2019s trouble.\u201d<\/span> There is no restriction on what you can write in your personal diary, which gives an avenue for creativity. For more effectiveness, ensure that each and every day, you write something in the journal. You will be surprised at how creative you are when you actually read your own journal one month later.<\/p>\n<h3>4) Play Imaginative Games<\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t think that playing games is a great excuse for you to get lazy just because you can improve your creativity only by playing imaginative games, not computer ones.\u00a0 But sometimes, these games can also help you <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with creative writing assignments<\/span>. What are these imaginative games? For example, \u2018What Happens Next?\u2019, \u2018Renaming\u2019, \u2018Opposites\u2019 or a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thoughtco.com\/be-creative-a-game-adult-learners-31400\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">game of I S-A<\/a>. Other than going out to a party or chatting on social media, use this precious time to play a game that will help enhance and improve your creativity. This will be like killing one bird with two stones. It\u2019s a nice way to refresh your mind while, at the same time, you will be working on your creativity.<\/p>\n<h3>5) Use Creative Writing Prompts<\/h3>\n<p>The best way to do so is through constant practice, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not only when you\u2019re thinking \u201cI need to find new creative assignment ideas.\u201d<\/span> Don\u2019t wait for the moment when you will be in an exam room.
