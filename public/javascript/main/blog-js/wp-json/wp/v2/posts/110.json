Most students struggle with their homework and, sometimes, this costs them dearly in getting the overall grade for a term. Have the same state of matters? You are welcome to the academic world where you can say, \u201cMy name is &#8230;, and I\u2019m an underachieving student too\u201d. Since you can\u2019t avoid assignments, the only option left is to learn the various stages of writing an assignment.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>This article is to help you with all the essential stages of writing. Eventually, you\u2019ll manage to write your own assignment quickly and easily.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Start a Writing Assignment: 3 Easy Pre-writing Steps<\/h2>\n<p>In the estimation of many students, the hardest part of writing any assignment is starting it. This is so largely true due to the fact that there are some basic steps that every student should take before starting to write an assignment. The problem with the majority of students is that they wait until the last minute to complete the assignment. \u00a0After that, they write the first sentence, and then delete it because they don\u2019t like how it sounds. Then, they sit staring at a blank piece of paper without knowing what should come first in an essay or research paper. A familiar situation to you?<\/p>\n<p>The problem with that is that you focus more on completing the assignment within the set timeframe and pay no attention to the stages of your writing:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-126\" src=\"https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/How-to-Start-a-Writing-Assignment.jpg\" alt=\"How to Start a Writing Assignment\" width=\"512\" height=\"235\" srcset=\"https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/How-to-Start-a-Writing-Assignment.jpg 512w, https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/How-to-Start-a-Writing-Assignment-300x138.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Let\u2019s focus on the pre-writing steps. Before you start writing the introduction to your assignment, you should:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><u><strong>Understand the question<\/strong><\/u> &#8211; <span style=\"background-color: #f1c40f;\">know what you\u2019re required to do<\/span>;<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><u><strong>Have a plan<\/strong><\/u> &#8211; <span style=\"background-color: #f1c40f;\">find out what you\u2019re able and want to cover<\/span>;<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><u><strong>Come up with your thesis statement<\/strong><\/u> &#8211; <span style=\"background-color: #f1c40f;\">state what it is expected of a paper<\/span>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h3>Understanding the Assignment Question<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nwp.org\/cs\/public\/download\/nwp_file\/15410\/Writing_Assignment_Framework_and_Overview.pdf?x-r=pcfile_d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Writing Assignment Framework and Overview<\/a> by the National Writing Project, a writing assignment is a writing task for students that can involve:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-130\" src=\"https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Understanding-the-Assignment-Question.jpg\" alt=\"Understanding the Assignment Question\" width=\"512\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Understanding-the-Assignment-Question.jpg 512w, https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Understanding-the-Assignment-Question-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before you can even write anything, you must understand the topic question. If you understand the assignment question, then you can\u2019t go off the topic. Ask yourself questions like:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffccff;\">What is the assignment about<\/span><\/strong> &#8211; a narrative or reflective essay?<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffccff;\">What is required of you<\/span><\/strong> &#8211; to analyze or evaluate?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Check for some keywords such as compare, contrast, discuss\u2026 These words will give you a clear picture of what the examiner expects of you. If there is any word used that you don\u2019t understand, take an initiative and find out what it means. If time is sufficient, consult your lecturer for further clarification. It might be so unfortunate to discover later that you didn\u2019t understand the topic\/assignment and, therefore, fail to perform that your educator requires. See if the assignment paper has words that limit you or if it is an open-ended question. Students who spend ample time understanding the assignment end up writing a good assignment and scoring high.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h3>Have an Effective Plan for an Assignment<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After you catch the question under discussion, you should plan your assignment. Look at it again and determine <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to write assignment in the most efficient manner<\/span>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span style=\"background-color: #00ccff;\">Word count<\/span><\/strong> &#8211; the ability to write under the precise terms of an assignment is highly appreciated. So don\u2019t write less or more than it is required in your assignment;<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span style=\"background-color: #00ccff;\">Information sources<\/span><\/strong> &#8211; the ability to use appropriate sources of information in your academic paper shows its credibility. So, it is in your interests to find the reliable sources from which you could take some facts or data;<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span style=\"background-color: #00ccff;\">Format peculiarities<\/span><\/strong> &#8211; the knowledge of formatting academic works <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">based on the assignment steps<\/span> influences their way of presentation to your readers (instructors, professors, young researchers, etc.) So, if you want to present your term paper, follow the style guide during the writing process. There is nothing complex to put the comma where it is required by one or another formatting style (APA, MLA, Harvard, etc.);<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span style=\"background-color: #00ccff;\">Time is needed to come up with a brilliant paper<\/span><\/strong> &#8211; the strong time management skills influence your academic performance. So, if you budget your time effectively, there are more chances to get the great results.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-132\" src=\"https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Effective-Plan-for-an-Assignment.jpg\" alt=\"Planning an Assignment\" width=\"512\" height=\"92\" srcset=\"https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Effective-Plan-for-an-Assignment.jpg 512w, https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Effective-Plan-for-an-Assignment-300x54.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Every college student can attest to the fact that when it comes to assignments, it is essential to know what and how to do them. Plan every step so that it helps you complete your assignments.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h3>Come Up with a Thesis Statement<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A thesis statement is undeniably the most important statement in an assignment, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of the core parts of assignment<\/span>. The thesis statement declares your stand on the topic, and this is also the statement that guides your readers to your writing assignment. Take into consideration the writing tips on thesis statements from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cws.illinois.edu\/workshop\/writers\/tips\/thesis\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the center for writing studies<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, you should formulate a clear thesis statement even before you begin writing the assignment itself. Specify your opinion concerning the main essay idea. Secondly, avoid generic statements. Specific word choice sharpens and clarifies your thesis statement. Be careful when coming up with a thesis statement as a wrong thesis statement is a recipe for failure. You are likely in favor of another way &#8211; the way towards the academic success.<\/p>\n<h2>What to Include in My Essay: 3 Parts of My Paper<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Different parts are present in different types of academic papers (be it a lab report, literature review, research paper, and so on). Let\u2019s consider 2 main types of assignment writing &#8211; an essay and research paper. If we speak about an essay assignment, you are supposed to include the introduction, main body, and the conclusion. If you need to write a coursework, it has more parts &#8211; abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion sections.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-136\" src=\"https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Essays-vs-Research-paper.jpg\" alt=\"Different parts Essays vs Research paper\" width=\"512\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Essays-vs-Research-paper.jpg 512w, https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Essays-vs-Research-paper-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h3>Writing an Introduction is Half the Battle with Your Assignment<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Every academic paper starts with the introduction. There is no escaping from it as the introductory paragraph determines if you are on the right writing track or simply don\u2019t understand the topic question. There is no debate about the importance of the introduction. Every student has to know how to write an introduction to an assignment, be it is an essay or term paper. The introduction should communicate the following information:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span style=\"background-color: #99ffcc;\">Contextual background of the topic<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"background-color: #99ffcc;\">.<\/span> The first point that you should give in the introduction of your assignment is the background of the topic. Write down the topic in your own words to make sure that you understand it. One of the mistakes made by most students while writing the introductory paragraph is that they repeat the assignment question word for word. This should not be the case if you want to impress your reader from the beginning. You are also required to find supportive materials from the credible authors who have written on the topic previously to support your contextual background;<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span style=\"background-color: #99ffcc;\">Stand on the issue<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"background-color: #99ffcc;\">.<\/span> You are expected to give an outline of the main ideas that you are going to discuss in the assignment. For example, if you cover the health care reform in your country, focus on the question \u201cWhat&#8217;s your position on health care reform?\u201d Write down some points concerning this issue. Usually, there should be two or more arguments that are opposite each other, then you should mention your own opinion backing up with strong evidence (research results in the form of statistics will come in handy);<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span style=\"background-color: #99ffcc;\">The thesis statement<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"background-color: #99ffcc;\">.<\/span> We\u2019ve already pointed out this important part of your essay. Remind you to work efficiently on it because it answers your topic question. Besides, remember the thesis statement\u2019s position &#8211; it should be the last sentence in the introduction paragraph. Students must get the thesis statement right if they want to score high in that particular assignment.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In fact, there are many common mistakes among students while dealing with the introduction. Below, you\u2019ll see some of them so that you could avoid them in your writing. Moreover, there are ways of writing a good introduction.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-138\" src=\"https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Writing-an-Introduction-is-Half-the-Battle-with-Your-Assignment.jpg\" alt=\"mistakes of writing an Assignment\" width=\"512\" height=\"288\" srcset=\"https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Writing-an-Introduction-is-Half-the-Battle-with-Your-Assignment.jpg 512w, https:\/\/domyassignments.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Writing-an-Introduction-is-Half-the-Battle-with-Your-Assignment-300x169.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h3>The Main Body Makes 80% of Your Assignment<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The body of your essay is the main part where you present all your arguments, analyze them in a logical and orderly manner. In other words, this is the part that can allow you either to win or reduce your grades. The structure of the main part should be:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffcc66;\">Topic sentence<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffcc66;\">.<\/span> Every paragraph of the main body should start with a sentence that introduces the main idea in the sentence. Each paragraph gives a new idea. The topic sentence should communicate the intention of the paragraph to the reader.<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffcc66;\">Evidence in the form of quotations and research studies<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffcc66;\">.<\/span> After presenting the topic sentence, you have to provide the strong evidence to support the main idea. The evidence should be in the form of citations, quotations or previous research studies.<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\"><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffcc66;\">Concluding sentence<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffcc66;\">.<\/span> While talking about the specific topic idea in the paragraph, you should arrive at the conclusive sentence. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you check out any steps of assignment writing example, you will see that<\/span> you should link all your ideas discussed in the paragraph(s) to your thesis statement.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<h3>The Conclusion Leaves Your Readers with the Final Impression<\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you want to heave a sigh of relief when it comes to writing a conclusion, you will go wrong. Despite that this is the final paragraph of your assignment, it is not less important to formulate all of your essay\u2019s main points once again. However, your task is to explain briefly the major ideas that you have discussed in the main body. The evidence you presented in the main body dictates what you will talk about in the conclusion. The last sentence of your conclusion paragraph should answer the topic question in a direct way. Avoid presenting new ideas in the conclusion paragraph.<\/p>\n<p>After reading all this, the only thing standing between you and good grades is following all these tips.
