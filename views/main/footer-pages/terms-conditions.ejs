									<p>“Referral Program” or “RP” means a complex of rules governing the process of
										earning bonuses by the existing Clients for referring third persons to the
										Website in capacity of new Clients, including all relevant material terms and
										conditions of such process and its substance.</p>
									<p>“Bonus” means discount for the Services represented in the form of coupon – an
										electronic document, which has specific characteristics: (i) the amount of the
										discount is 10$, (ii) term of its validity is 30 calendar days, and (iii)
										eligible to be used with the single Order, which price exceeds 25$; it expires
										automatically.</p>

										Website in capacity of new Clients, eligible for Bonus.</p>
									<p>“Referred Client” means third person, which was referred by the Referring Client
										and, upon acceptance of T&amp;C and further use of the Website, constitutes a
										new Client, eligible for Bonus.</p>
								</li>
								<li><span class="terms-sub-title">Eligibility for Referral Program</span>
									<ol>
										<li>In order to participate in RP, the Referring Client has to be an actual
											Client in good standing, meaning - being in compliance with T&amp;C in
											force, who has approved and completed at least one Order prior to the
											referral.
										</li>
										<li>Any third person, who is eligible to become a Client, may become a Referred
											Client, and no specific requirements, except provided by these Referral
											Terms, have to be met.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li><span class="terms-sub-title">Referral Process</span>
									<ol>
										<li>Every existing Client, eligible to participate, has an opportunity to
											participate in RP by inviting a third party to use the Services of the
											Website.
										</li>
										<li>Invitation has to be done using the Client’s interface – clicking the tab
											“Invite a friend”, which is located in the Client’s Account. The Client
											would be able to copy the invitation link, which leads to the Website, and
											send it to any third person (“Invited Person”) by any means of choice
											(e-mail, messengers, etc.)
										</li>
										<li>The Invited Person may follow the link and register an Account according to
											the T&amp;C, thus becoming a Referred Client.
										</li>
										<li>Such Referred Client receives Bonus to his/her Account automatically at the
											moment of registration. This Bonus would be automatically applied to the
											first (or the next one in case of Referring Client) Order. Confirmation of
											the Order with such discount constitutes its appropriate use and shall
											exhaust it.
										</li>
										<li>The Referring Client receives Bonus to his/her Account each time the
											Referred Client(s) uses Bonus appropriately at the moment when Referred
											Client finishes the Order. Algorithm of such Referring Client’s Bonus use is
											the same as for the Referred Client.
										</li>
										<li>Neither Referring, nor Referred Client may use more than one Bonus per one
											Order. At the same time, Bonuses are not cumulative.
										</li>
										<li>The number of invitation links, so as the number of Referred Clients, issued
											by one Referring Client is limitless.
										</li>
										<li>In no case the Bonus shall be provided in any other form (including cash,
											wire transfer) than the coupon with a discount.
										</li>
										<li>Bonus does not stick with another Bonus, or any other discount provided by
											Us.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li><span class="terms-sub-title">Restrictions and limitations</span>
									<ol>
										<li>The invitation link should only be used for personal and non-commercial
											purposes, such as sale or barter. It also should not be published or
											distributed by any commercial means, such as coupon website, or by improper
											means, such as “spamming” (meaning unsolicited commercial advertisement in
											scope of Law of the United States CAN-SPAM Act of 2003).</li>
										<li>Multiply referrals are allowed and no number of referrals sent shall be
											deemed as abuse of these rules.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>We reserve the right to suspend/terminate the Referral Program or alternate the
									rules upon any reason we deem appropriate.</li>
								<li>If We reasonably suspect that You, either as Referring or Referred Client, act
									abusively, fraudulently, or in violation of Referral Program, we may suspend Your
									access and, consequently, terminate Your use of the Website according to section 13
									of T&amp;C.
								</li>
								<li>
									We would notify the Referring Client on subject matter of: (i) when the Referred
									Client placed an Order, (ii) when the Referred Client finished an Order. We reserve
									the right to notify and communicate with both Referring and Referred Client on any
